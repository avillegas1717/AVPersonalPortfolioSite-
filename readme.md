# 🍸 AV Personal Portfolio Site
Following KCWiT's Coding &amp; Cocktails series worksheets to build a custom portfolio site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; React. 

## 💻 Tech Stack

This site is built using:

- **HTML5** – for the structure
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity
- **React** – for reusable components and a dynamic UI

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This portfolio is being built step-by-step as I progress through the Coding & Cocktails series. It's intentionally developed from scratch with minimal libraries to focus on understanding the fundamentals of front-end development.

## 📁 Features (Planned)

- Home/About Me
- Projects Showcase
- Contact Form
- Blog Posts
- Responsive Design
- Dynamic Year in Footer
- React component structure
- Possibly a light/dark theme toggle (if I get fancy)

## 🎯 Goals

- Solidify front-end development skills
- Gain confidence building a complete project
- Showcase my growth and learning journey
- Launch a live version of the site via GitHub Pages

## ♿ Accessibility Goals

Inclusive design is a core value of this project. As I build this portfolio, I’m intentionally focusing on:

- Writing semantic HTML for better screen reader compatibility
- Ensuring good color contrast for readability
- Providing clear focus indicators for keyboard users
- Making sure interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation
- Adding `aria` attributes where needed (but not overusing them!)
- Testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies

> Accessibility isn't a feature — it's a foundation.

As I grow, I aim to continuously improve this site’s accessibility and follow best practices from WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).


## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm a front-end developer passionate about clean code, creative design, accessibility, & community-based learning. Coding & Cocktails is a small way I can give back to the Kansas City tech commuity for providing a welcoming & inclusive community to learn & grow!

Built with love, code, & cocktails 🍹
