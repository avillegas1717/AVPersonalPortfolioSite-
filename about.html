    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I’m Alicia Villegas — a front-end developer passionate about accessibility, clean code, and user-focused design. My journey into tech is a bit unconventional, but each chapter — from leadership to professional photography — sharpened my problem-solving, communication, and creativity, all skills I bring into any team.
      <br><br>
      I transitioned into tech by completing a full stack coding bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more. While the program gave me a solid full stack foundation, I quickly gravitated toward front-end development, where design, accessibility, and user experience intersect.
      <br><br>
      Following bootcamp, I completed an IT help desk apprenticeship that combined certification preparation with 6 months of on-the-job training. During this time, I earned certifications including Microsoft 365 & Azure fundamentals as well as CompTIA A+. I also studied for Microsoft Endpoint Administrator and CompTIA Network+.  The program wrapped up when I relocated, but the hands-on experience deepened my understanding of how systems work and how users interact with technology in the real world.
      <br><br>
      Today, my focus is on front-end development and making the web more accessible. I also teach with KCWiT’s (Kansas City Women in Technology) Coding & Cocktails program, where I’ve helped improve presentation slide accessibility while mentoring new learners. Teaching keeps my skills sharp and reinforces my commitment to writing thoughtful, inclusive code.
      <br><br>
      Accessibility is more than just a technical requirement for me — it’s a passion. I believe everyone deserves equal access to information and experiences on the web, regardless of ability. Creating inclusive designs that remove barriers and welcome all users drives me to write clean & thoughtful code.
      <br><br>
      In my free time you’ll usually find me exploring NW Arkansas with my dog Gizmo (parks, trails & pup-friendly coffee shops), painting, collecting vinyl, or catching live concerts. These hobbies keep me grounded, inspired, and remind me to bring creativity & rhythm into everything I build.
      <br><br>
      I'm a quick learner, clear communicator, and eager to tackle new challenges. I’m excited to join a team where I can grow as a front-end developer and help build web experiences that truly serve everyone.</p>
